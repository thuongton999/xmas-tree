# Three.js dancing Tree (for Xmas)

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/thuongton999/pen/VwRYaRw](https://codepen.io/thuongton999/pen/VwRYaRw).

A three.js experiment. That's how I learned some more about instanced geometry (instanced mesh should do the job as well - I just had no time to try it). Anyway, that took me some time to make things work but I kind of like the final result. Merry Xmas
